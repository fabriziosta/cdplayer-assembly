This MS-DOS program was created in Windows 10 using a virtual machine (I have tried the application in virtualbox, vmware, dosBox)
OS: 	MS-DOS 6.22 with Italian layout
Tools:	Turbo C 3.0, TASM(Turbo Assembler 2.01), NBASM(NewBasic Assembler 00.24.95), MSCDEX 2.23

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: 
There are 2 folders in my project, WORKING VERSION and NOT WORKING VERSION.
- WORKING VERSION is a TUI application for plain MS-DOS and this was created using NBASM.
	This is made up of 2 files:
		A) SUP.ASM - Assembly file of my project. It contains all the source code.
		B) SUP.COM - Assembled version of my project

- NOT WORKING VERSION is a GUI application for plain MS-DOS and this was created using Turbo C and TASM.
	This is made up of 3 files:
		A) MAIN.C - Source code
		B) MAIN.OBJ - Compiled version of my project.
		C) MAIN.EXE - Executable version of my project. It can be executed but buttons are not going to work.
